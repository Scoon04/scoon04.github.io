The main focus of this system is to host UART communication through the other 2 systems and to communicate wirelessly with the HMI through MQTT server. This schematic doesnt show much of its functionallity becuase its functionallity is code and server based, but it does show the pins that will be used to communitate with the other PCBs and how power will be distributed to other boards. The 9V power rail comes from the barrel jack and into the pin out so it can go to other boards, and the RX and TX come in and out of the board through the in and out connectors.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/Old-Block-Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/Old-Block-Diagram/#version-1","title":"Version 1","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/Old-Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/Old-Component-Selection/#pic-microcontroller","title":"PIC Microcontroller","text":"Component Pros Cons PIC18F47Q10-I/PT TQFP$1.22Product Page - More Pins- 128KB Flash Size - Slightly Larger Size- Don't need all the pins- Most Expensive PIC18F27Q10-I/SS SSOP$1.02Product Page - Larger Operating Temperature Range- Smaller Size- 128KB Flash Size- E/STX are better designed for embeded systems- Less Expensive - Less Pins PIC18F26Q10-I/SS SSOP$0.91Product Page - Smaller Size- Larger Operating Temperature- E/STX are better designed for embeded systems- Less Expensive - Only 64KB Flash Size- Less Pins <p>Selected Part</p> <p>PIC18F27Q10-I/SS SSOP was selected due to its optimal size for my use case, high flash size, and pins count.
