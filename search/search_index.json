This method sets up an alternative DOM implementation, which you don't need in the browser, and tells MathJax to use node's <code>require()</code> command to load external modules.  This setup will not work properly in the browser, even if you webpack it or bundle it in other ways.</p> <p>See the documentation and the MathJax Node Repository for more details.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#reducing-the-size-of-the-components-directory","title":"Reducing the Size of the Components Directory","text":"<p>Since the <code>es5</code> directory contains all the component files, so if you are only planning one use one configuration, you can reduce the size of the MathJax directory by removing unused components. For example, if you are using the <code>tex-chtml.js</code> component, then you can remove the <code>tex-mml-chtml.js</code>, <code>tex-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-mml-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-chtml-full.js</code>, and <code>tex-svg-full.js</code> configurations, which will save considerable space.  Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>, and the <code>input/tex/extensions</code>, <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code>, <code>adaptors</code>, <code>a11y</code>, and <code>sre</code> directories.  If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.  If you are using MathML input rather than TeX (e.g., <code>mml-chtml.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), then you can remove <code>input/tex/extensions</code> as well.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#the-component-files-and-pull-requests","title":"The Component Files and Pull Requests","text":"<p>The <code>es5</code> directory is generated automatically from the contents of the MathJax source repository.
