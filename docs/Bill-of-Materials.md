## BOM

This is a detailed list of all the parts used in my system, with a breakdown of price per unit as well as detailes about the manufacturer, supplier, links to the parts, and their designation on the [Schematic](Schematic.md). I decided to use a minimum component size of 1206 for generic components so they are easier to solder. 

| Part Name | Unit Quantity | Cost per Unit (Prototype) | Total Prototype Cost | Cost per Unit (Production) | Total Production Cost | Manufacturer | Manufacturer Part # | Vendor Link | Datasheet Link | Supplier | Supplier Part # | # Ordered | Date Ordered | # Recieved | Surplus | Designator |
