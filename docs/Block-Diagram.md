My block diagram shows the components and their communication with the microcontroller. Because my section is the MQTT server, there arent many electrical components to show. There are some general buttons for programing and debuging, as well as a block for the micro usb port for programing. The uart pins are shown for showing how I will be sending and recieving data from my teamates boards.

I added a 9V motor controlled by a transistor for the final showcase of the project. This was to give us something more presentable and exciting for our audience.
