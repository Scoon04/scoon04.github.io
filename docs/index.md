## MQTT System Introduction

For ASU's Spring 2025 semester of the class EGR 314, my responsibility for my teams project is managing wireless data transfer through an MQTT server. For more information about the overall project, check the [team website](https://egr314-2025-s-309.github.io/) (also linked below). I will be using an ESP32 chip to send and recieve data from our projects HMI (human machine interface) and then sending that data through a uart data stream for my teamates systems to use. I also plan on being the host for the power supply to the other systems.
