This schematic is simple electrically. The main focus of this system is to host UART communication through the other 2 systems and to communicate wirelessly with the HMI through MQTT server. This schematic doesnt show much of its functionallity becuase its functionallity is code and server based, but it does show the pins that will be used to communitate with the other PCBs and how power will be distributed to other boards. The 9V power rail comes from the barrel jack and into the pin out so it can go to other boards, and the RX and TX come in and out of the board through the in and out connectors.
